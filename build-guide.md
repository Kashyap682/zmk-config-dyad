## Tools List
Many of these components have acceptable alternatives, just be sure to double check the PCB footprint requirements.

| Component | Comment |
|-----------|-------------|
| Soldering Iron | A very fine soldering iron tip is preferred for surface mount connections. |
| Precision Tip Tweezers | These are very useful for orienting and holding the small components. |
| Hotplate | This is necessary to solder otherwise inaccessible connections between the microcontroller and PCB (I used my gas stove and a piece of aluminum). |
| Parallel Jaw Pliers | These aren't strictly necessary, but I found them very helpful for installing the press-fit nuts and spring pins into the PCB. |
| Hex Key | You'll need a tool to install whichever screws you decide on. The screws I've listed in the parts list take a 0.050" hex key. |
| Flush Cutters | These are used for cutting down some protruding pins from the back of the PCB where the battery is going to rest. |
| Multimeter | This is useful for double checking your components and workmanship, as well as troubleshooting. |
